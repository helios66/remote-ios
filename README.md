Remote is a little project born out of my laziness and not wanting to carry about my samsung galaxy Note 4. which is a powerful but heavy device, I feel more comfortable with the iPhone because of the smaller size. My days of compensating for size are long gone ‚úåüèæ.

So, I wrote an **iOS** app to perform basic tasks on my **Android** phone without having to touch the Android phone..

Now, let&#39;s manage out wifi hotspot remotely and lock/unlock our devices because we are too lazy to stand up from the chair when bae calls because she needs your hotspot.

P.S: You'll need to set up Firebase for your iOS project, download and setup the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the same project as your android app project. The Android and iOS apps must share the same project on firebase.
